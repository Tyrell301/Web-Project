            <P>People began settling in Norway very early - in 9000 BC.Settlers survived by hunting and fishing animals such as seal, deer, elk and whales. Farming didn't become prominent until 500 BC.
                The famous Vikings are a big part of Norway's history. Known as the Viking Age, from 800 AD to 1050 AD the Vikings raided various places including Ireland, France, England and Scotland, traveling by extremely fast ocean-going ships they created. These people are known largely for being ruthless fighters, but this wasn't their only claim to fame. Their other talents included craftsmanship, trading and administrating.
                The Vikings ended up founding a few different cities, including Normandy and Dublin. However, the Viking Age ended when Harald Hardrada unsuccessfully attempted to conquer England in 1066.
